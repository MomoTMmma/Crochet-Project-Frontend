                        <p>Hello my name is April and this is my website for my handmade crochet products. 
                            <br></br>
                            I am a new startup with a major passion for crochet and making quality products. 
                            <br></br>
                            While my selection is currently limited I hope to expand on my selection of products soon which I am excited to release.
                            <br></br>
                            I pick the best material to work with so the items wont shrink when washed.
                            <br></br> 
                            All of my items are ready for purchase and can ship only in the US.
                            <br></br>
                            Shipping outside of US coming soon. 
                            <br></br>
                            My amazing sister build this website for me.
                            <br></br>
